TouchLink technology allows you to create a separate zigbee network between two devices. For communication supporting technology devices, you should familiarize yourself with the documentation. Ikea stores sell Tradfri lamp and remote control kits that support this pairing. Usually to pair the lamp and the remote control, you need to bring the remote control to the included light and press the pairing button. After some time, the lamp will blink with increasing frequency. After some time, the blinking will stop, the devices will need to create their own network and register for device events.</p><p>#Binding The zigbee protocol also provides settings for device communications with the coordinator. This technology is called Binding. It allows you to similarly sign some devices (lamps) to others (remotes, sensors), only configuration is done through the coordinator. This allows you to fine-tune communications without creating a separate zigbee network.</p><h1 id="view-zigbee2mqtt-or-sls-zgw-logs" tabindex="-1">View zigbee2mqtt or SLS ZGW logs <a class="header-anchor" href="#view-zigbee2mqtt-or-sls-zgw-logs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;View zigbee2mqtt or SLS ZGW logs&quot;">​</a></h1><p>In addition to MajorDoMo, you can view the log file of the software gateway.
